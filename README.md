**Classification of Mice Based on Protein Expression Levels**
This project focuses on analyzing protein expression levels in the cerebral cortex of mice to classify them into different categories based on genotype, behavior, and treatment. The aim is to understand the biological mechanisms underlying learning and memory, especially in the context of Down syndrome.

**Objective**
* Classify Mice: Develop a machine learning model to classify mice into one of eight classes based on 77 protein expression levels.
* Identify Key Proteins: Use feature selection to find proteins that distinguish between classes, providing insights into learning and memory processes.
* Analyze Impact: Evaluate the effects of genotype, behavior, and treatment on protein expression and associative learning.

**Tools and Technologies**
* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries:
   * Pandas: Data manipulation
    * NumPy: Numerical computations
    * Scikit-learn: Machine learning
    * Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
* IDE: Jupyter Notebook

**Methodology**
1. Data Preprocessing:
* Handle missing values.
* Normalize/scale protein expression levels.
* Encode categorical variables.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Visualize data distribution and relationships.
* Analyze correlations between proteins.

3. Feature Selection:
* Identify redundant features.
* Use model-based techniques to determine key proteins.

4. Model Training:
* Split data into training and testing sets.
* Experiment with models like Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks.
* Optimize hyperparameters for best performance.

5. Model Evaluation:
* Assess models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Visualize performance with confusion matrices.

6. Result Interpretation:
* Identify key proteins and their biological significance.
* Discuss the implications for Down syndrome research.
